                    <h3>5.3 Billing and Payment</h3>
                    <p>All payments are processed by Paddle, our Merchant of Record. By subscribing to BondSketch, you agree to the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> Paddle (Paddle.com Market Limited or Paddle.com Inc, depending on your location) processes all payments using methods such as credit card, debit card, PayPal, and other available payment options</li>
                        <li><strong>Billing Cycle:</strong> Subscription fees are billed in advance on a monthly or annual basis</li>
                        <li><strong>Currency:</strong> All fees are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated</li>
                        <li><strong>Taxes:</strong> Taxes (VAT, GST, sales tax) are included in the displayed subscription prices. Paddle handles all tax calculations and compliance based on your location</li>
                        <li><strong>Invoices and Receipts:</strong> You agree to receive all invoices and receipts in electronic format via email from Paddle</li>
                        <li><strong>Authorization:</strong> You authorize Paddle to charge your payment method for all fees incurred, including applicable taxes</li>
                        <li><strong>Price Changes:</strong> Prices are subject to change with 30 days' notice. If a Paid Subscription price increases, Paddle will notify you and seek your consent to continue if required</li>
                        <li><strong>Payment Information:</strong> You must provide accurate and up-to-date payment information. Paddle is not responsible for non-delivery of services due to incorrect information</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For full details on payment processing, please refer to <a href="https://www.paddle.com/legal/checkout-buyer-terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paddle's Checkout Buyer Terms</a>.</p>

                    <h3>5.4 Automatic Renewal</h3>
                    <p>Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing period unless you cancel before the renewal date. Paddle will charge your payment method between 00:00 and 01:00 UTC on the day your subscription renews. You will be charged the then-current subscription fee.</p>

                    <p>You can cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings in the BondSketch app. Cancellation will take effect at the end of your current billing period, and you will retain access to the Service until that time. If you cannot access your account, contact BondSketch support at cuong@dotochy.com for assistance with cancellation.</p>

                    <h2>6. Consumer Rights and Refunds</h2>

                    <h3>6.1 Consumer Right to Cancel (EU/UK Residents)</h3>
                    <p>If you are a consumer located in the European Union or United Kingdom, you have the right to cancel your purchase within 14 days from the date of purchase of a paid subscription without giving any reason, subject to the exception below.</p>

                    <p><strong>Exception - Waiver of Cancellation Right:</strong> Because BondSketch is digital content that is made immediately available upon purchase of a paid subscription, by continuing to use the Service after your purchase, you expressly consent to immediate performance of this agreement and acknowledge that you will lose your right of withdrawal once you begin using the paid Service.</p>

                    <p>This means that once you purchase a paid subscription and continue using BondSketch, your 14-day cancellation right is waived. This is why we offer a 7-day free trial to allow you to test the Service before committing to a paid subscription. During the free trial, you may cancel at any time without any payment or obligation.</p>

                    <h3>6.2 Refund Policy</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>7-Day Free Trial:</strong> Cancel anytime during the trial period without charge. No credit card required for trial. This serves as your opportunity to evaluate the Service before purchase.</li>
                        <li><strong>Post-Trial Refunds:</strong> After the free trial period ends and you begin a paid subscription, refunds are provided at the sole discretion of Paddle on a case-by-case basis. Paddle may refuse refund requests if they find evidence of fraud, refund abuse, or other manipulative behavior.</li>
                        <li><strong>Consumer Rights:</strong> This refund policy does not affect your rights as a consumer in relation to products which are not as described, faulty, or not fit for purpose.</li>
                        <li><strong>Billing Errors:</strong> If Paddle or BondSketch detects billing errors or technical issues, refunds may be issued at our discretion.</li>
                        <li><strong>Wire Transfer Payments:</strong> Orders paid via wire transfer are not eligible for refunds, except for sales tax refunds above $100 at Paddle's discretion.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>For refund requests, please contact Paddle support through their buyer support channels. All refund decisions are made by Paddle as the Merchant of Record.</p>

                    <h3>6.3 Downgrades</h3>
                    <p>If you downgrade from Plus to Basic plan:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cloud storage access will be disabled</li>
                        <li>You will need to export your structures before downgrading</li>
                        <li>The change takes effect at the end of the current billing period</li>
                        <li>No refunds will be provided for the difference in subscription fees</li>

                    <h3>9.1 Data Storage</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Basic Plan:</strong> Your chemical structures are stored locally in your browser. We do not have access to or store your structures on our servers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Plus Plan:</strong> Your structures are stored on our secure cloud servers. We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data.</li>
